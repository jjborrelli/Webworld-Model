## Functions

# Function that defines a species by pulling L numbers randomly from 1:K

# Function that then compares the traits between two species to determine the score.Is there:
#### 1. An interaction 
#### 2. If there is an interaction:
######## a. What is the interaction strength

# Function governing population dynamics to be fed into the solver

# Function which determines if there is a speciation event determined by population size
